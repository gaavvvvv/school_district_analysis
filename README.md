# School District Analysis
## Purpose & Overview
-I'm helping Maria aggregate and analyze on data on schools, students, and math & reading scores to help the school board make important decisions regarding funding. I'm using jupyter notebook and python to help me sort through the data, build different data frames and perform calculations which will highlight trends and significant statistics. Some of the data was deemed to be academically dishonest so we had to take remove it from and redo the calculations.
## Results
- Math and Reading Scores by Grade: 9th grade avg goes down, 10th grade avg unaffected, 11th grade avg unaffected, 12th grade avg unaffected
- Scores by School Type: Charter avg goes down, District avg unaffected
- Scores by Size: Small avg unaffected, Medium avg goes down, Large avg unaffected
- Scores by Spending: $585-629 avg unaffacted, $630-644 avg goes down, $645-675 avg unaffected
## Summary
- Losing the entire Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores really only has a major impact on the Thomas High School statistics and the 9th grade data as a whole (all the schools). The 10th, 11th, 12th grade score averages would all be unaffected and all the other schools, besides Thomas High, would be the same as from our initial calculations. The other types of data that are affected by the 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School are the "Type" (charter), "Size" (medium), and "Spending" ($630-644)
